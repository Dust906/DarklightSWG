# DarklightSWG
This version of the SWGEmu Core3 has been Open Sourced.

We the former Developers of DarklightSWG have simply become jaded with the greater SWG Emulation community and are burnt out to the point where we no longer have the desire to finish what we started here.

This project has been open sourced in the hope that someone willing will finish what we started.
